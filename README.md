# Powershell-Scripts
A collection of PowerShell scripts written to automate or assist with various work tasks. Not runnable in current state as all identifiable information has been replaced with "Redacted".
This repo is intented to serve as a general overview of my general proficiency in Powershell (and general coding practices) for prospective hiring managers or employers rather than as a forkable repo with directly useable code.
